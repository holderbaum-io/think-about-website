# Our Consensus {#backtotop}

The approach we have chosen to create a safe conference for everyone is based on these layers:

All participants have to agree on our [Code of Conduct](#coc).

With our [Message of Empowerment](#empowerment) we want to encourage everyone to
seize their rights!

Our on-site [Awareness-Team](#awareness) is available to support you and keep everyone safe.

We also would like to promote a policy of [ethical usage of personal data](#privacy).
