# Our Consensus {#backtotop}

To create a safe conference for everyone we implemented three different layers:

All participants have to agree on our [Code of Conduct](#coc).

In our [Message of Empowerment](#empowerment) we want to encourage everyone to
seize their rights!

In case of harassment our on-site [Awareness-Team](#awareness) is available to
support you and to enforce these rules.

Moreover do we want to promote an [ethical usage of personal Data](#privacy).
