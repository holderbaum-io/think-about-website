# Think About: Tickets

This is the first time we plan a conference. But we attended some. Okay a lot... That helps because this way we have a long list of things we want to do differently. A lot of ideas and a lot of stuff we want to think about. For example ticket prices.

Our ticket prices allow us to support diversity and solidarity throughout our conference.
