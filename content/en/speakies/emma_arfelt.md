Emma Arfelt is an MSc student in Computer Science at the IT University of Copenhagen. Prior she finished her bachelor degree in Software Development, which sparked her interest in IT Security and spun an adventure into Security research. Outside study hours, Emma works as a privacy advocate in high schools, where she teaches young adults about digital footprints and digital rights on the Internet.
Further, she’s a self-taught DJ (not Spotify-like, but a truly spinning-scratching-fancy-headphone type of DJ) with a pumping heart for groovy 70’s disco, and loves hipster-friendly Cortados.
