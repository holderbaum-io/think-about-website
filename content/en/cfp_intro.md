#Call for paper?

We did not run a CfP for the Think About! 2019 and we won't for the next years. The reason is simply that we are focusing on many different aspects in our speaker lineup: gender and ethnical diversity, good mixture of technical and non-technical topics that work with each other, amateurs and seasoned speakers and of course a sensible combination of locals and people from far away. 

We personally believe that introducing a CfP is limiting ourselves to the submissions we get and thus makes it immediately harder to focus on the aspects above.

If you however have a topic that concerns itself with tech, design and their impacts on society and you agree with our Code of Conduct feel free to reach out to us directly.
