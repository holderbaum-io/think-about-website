#Call for Participation?

We are not running an official Call for Participation (CfP) for the Think About! 2020. The reason is simply that we are focusing on many different aspects in our speaker lineup: gender- and ethnical diversity, good mixture of technical and non-technical topics that work with each other, amateurs and seasoned speakers and of course a sensible combination of locals and people from far away.

We believe that introducing a CfP would limit us to the submissions we get and thus makes it immediately harder to focus on the aspects above.

If you however have a topic that concerns itself with tech, design and their impacts on society and you agree with our [Code of Conduct](https://think-about.io/consensus.html#coc) feel free to reach out to us directly.
