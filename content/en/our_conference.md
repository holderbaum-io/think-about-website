Think About! is a Tech Conference with focus not only on Technology but
on Design and Social Impact as well.

It creates a safe and inspirational space for everyone, and we really mean
everyone.

Our believe is that society needs diversity in order to carry on a healthy and
critical dialogue. For this reason we want to bring together diverse
individuals and enable them to challenge themselves and each other.
