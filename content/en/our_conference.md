**Think About!** is a tech conference which focuses not only on technology
but also on design and it's social impact. It creates a safe and
inspirational space for everyone, and we really mean **everyone**. 

Our belief is that society needs diversity in order to continue a healthy
and critical dialogue. For this reason we want to bring together diverse
individuals and enable them to challenge themselves and each other.
