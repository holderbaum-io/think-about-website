# Hi, I am Jakob

Visiting and speaking at tech conferences sparked my enthusiasm for conferences
as a utility to bring people together. For me, Think About! is a way to have a meaningful impact on a part of our society.

Outside of organizing Think About! I work as a consultant for agile software
delivery teams.
