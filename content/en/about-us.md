# About Us!

We are Andreas, Chrissi and Jakob from Cologne, Germany! We are three human-beings partly with technical, partly with activist backgrounds who are realizing a long time dream to make our own conference possible. Under the name of [HRX](https://hrx.events/) we are currently planning the event in our free time among our daily jobs in the tech industry.

If you have any questions or feedback for us, or you simply want to get to know us please feel free to reach out at any time. **We are grateful for any kind of input as Think About! lives on people that give us something to think about.**
