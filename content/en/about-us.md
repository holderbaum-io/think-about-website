# About Us!

We are Andreas, Chrissi, Jakob and Rudi from Cologne, Germany! We are three
human-beings and a dog who are realizing a long time dream to make their own
conference possible. Under the name of [HRX](https://hrx.events/) we are
currently planning the event in our free time among our daily jobs in the tech
industry.

Our world should become a better and safer place for every human being –
regardless of their personal backgrounds and beliefs. **So let’s come together
and do something great!**

If you have any questions or feedback for us, or you simply want to get to know
us please feel free to reach out at any time.
