# Our Location

#### Cinenova, Cologne-Ehrenfeld

The Conference will take place in a cozy cinema right in the center of the
Ehrenfeld district in Cologne. It provides us with two big halls for talks,
unlimited drinks, free popcorn and regional organic catering services.

But do not worry about not seeing the sunlight: The Cinenova has a sunny
outdoor area as well.
