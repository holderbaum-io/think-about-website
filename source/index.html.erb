Creating an event that is driven by our values was the main motivation for the
<b>Think About! 2019</b>. This event was mainly focussed on four values:
Diversity, Awareness, Solidarity and Privacy. 
      </p>
      <p>
<b>Thanks again</b> to everyone who helped making the first edition of the
Think About! possible. Without you the event would not have been as amazing,
inspiring and magical as it was.

          <h1>Think About <em>Design!</em></h1>
          <p>
Nearly everything we use today is designed - whether itâ€™s an app to monitor a
menstrual cycle or self driving cars. Beside others we will cover topics such
as design ethics and product and UX design.

          <h1>Think About <em>Society!</em></h1>
Technology &amp; design continue to shape humanity as a whole. Topics like
discrimination, social and economic equity, and participation in our society
are more important than ever. We want to create a platform to talk and discuss
these topics.
