          <p>
            Nearly everything we use today is designed - whether itâ€™s an app to
            monitor a menstrual cycle or self driving cars. Beside others we
            will cover topics such as design ethics and product and UX design.

          <p>
            Technology &amp; design continue to shape humanity as a whole.
            Topics like discrimination, social and economic equity, and
            participation in our society are more important than ever. We want
            to create a platform to talk and discuss these topics.
