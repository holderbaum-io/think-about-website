        <b>Think About!</b> is a tech conference which focuses not only on
        technology but also on design and their social impact. It creates a
        safe and inspirational space for everyone, and we really mean
        <b>everyone</b>.

        Our belief is that society needs diversity in order to continue a
        healthy and critical dialogue. For this reason, we want to bring
        together diverse individuals and enable them to challenge themselves
        and each other.

          <p>
            Nearly everything we use today is designed - whether itâ€™s an app to
            monitor a menstrual cycle or self driving cars. Beside others we
            will cover topics such as design ethics and product and UX design.

          <p>
            Technology &amp; design continue to shape humanity as a whole.
            Topics like discrimination, social and economic equity, and
            participation in our society are more important than ever. We want
            to create a platform to talk and discuss these topics.
