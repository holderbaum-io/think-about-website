Many events around the world are cancelled or postponed due to the Corona
Virus. As of now, the Think About! will still happen in June. Here are our
thoughts.

As stated above, given the information we have as of today **we are not
considering to postpone or cancel the Think About! on June 4th and 5th**.

No attendee asked so far whether Think About! will take place or not - but we
want to be transparent about our thoughts and reasoning nevertheless.

We are following the news and try to stay informed. Should it become clear that
the event must not take place in June, we will of course reimburse all
attendees that bought a ticket so far. The reimbursement of already occurred
travel cost for our speakers is of course unaffected as well. We will pay these
cost whether the Think About! happens or not.

## Why we are not Cancelling as of now?

Pulling off an event like the Think About! is a tremendous effort - measured in
hours invested by the Orga Team and measured in money invested upfront for
Hotel, Travel and so on. Since we are a small company, we have to pay a lot of
this upfront from our own pockets - many of the cost are not refundable.

We are serious about you health and safety, so if the government and health
institutes issue a concrete cancellation warning for June - we will of course
comply. But until this isn't the case we stay positive and believe that we can
cope with this global thread in the coming months.
