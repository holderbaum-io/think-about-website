Many events around the world are cancelled or postponed due to the Corona
Virus. As of now the Think About! will still happen in June. Here are our
thoughts.

Given the information we have as of today **we are not considering to postpone 
or cancel the Think About! on June 4th and 5th**.

None of the attendees raised any concers so far but we still want to be transparent 
about our thoughts and reasoning.

We are following the news and keep in touch with the public health department in 
Cologne on a weekly basis. Should it become clear that the event must not take 
place in June we will of course **reimburse all attendees that bought a ticket so far**. 
The reimbursement of already occurred travel cost for our speakers is of course unaffected 
as well. **We will pay these cost whether the Think About! happens or not.**

## Why are we not Cancelling as of now?

Pulling off an event like the Think About! is a tremendous effort - measured in
hours invested by the orga team and measured in money invested upfront for
hotel, travel and so on. Since we are a small company we have to pay a lot of
this upfront from our own pockets - many of the cost are not refundable.

**Nevertheless we take your health and safety seriously so if the government and health
institutes issue a concrete cancellation warning for June we will of course
comply.** But until this isn't the case we stay positive and believe that we can
cope with this global thread in the coming months.

## What are your thoughts?

If you have any concers, ideas or recommendations for this unique situation please don't 
hesitate to drop us [a message](mailto:kontakt@think-about.io) and let us know what you think.
