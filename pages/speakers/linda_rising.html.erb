          Research has identified what I like to call "an agile mindset," an attitude that equates failure and problems with opportunities for learning, a belief that we can all improve over time, that our abilities are not fixed but evolve with effort.
        <p>
          What's surprising about this research is the impact of our mindset on creativity and innovation, estimation, and collaboration in and out of the workplace.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll share what we know so far about this mindset and offer some practical suggestions to help all of us become even more agile.
