November 15th we officially launched the [ticket sales](/en/tickets.html) of
the first installment of the Think About! Conference. And this is what we
learned so far.

Prior to our launch we had many conversations with potential users about our
content and our pricing. All of these conversations sparked discussions in the
founder team and lead to many conceptual changes over the course of the last
year.

Releasing a product to the public -- be it a service, a physical thing or as in
our case an event with tickets -- is a great opportunity to get real user
feedback. And this is exactly what we did. We talked to a lot of people that
already bought a ticket as well as to people that did not buy a ticket yet. And
we wanted to know their reasons.

## The main Theme

It became quite clear that the ticket price is appropriate for such a
conference in general -- but too high for a newcomer conference. Putting down
several hundred Euros for a conference organized by unknown individuals for the
first time takes a lot of trust.

This lead us to the decision of rethinking our pricing structure in order to
find a more suitable pricing-model for our newcomer conference. Below is a
breakdown and summary of our cost structure, how we changed it and our thinking
process along the way.

## The Journey towards the right Ticket Price

Surprisingly, pricing is one of the most complex conceptual problems we faced
during the ramp up. It is a tug war between planning for safety, providing a
great experience for all attendees and keeping the price low to be open to a
more diverse crowd of people.

The biggest cost-factor (nearly half of the ticket revenue) is spent on **lease
for the [location](https://www.cinenova.de/) and food including beverages**.

We want to have healthy and genuinely good food for all attendees, which is why
we picked a caterer that provides us with regional and organic food throughout
the event. Therefore the biggest chunk in our budget is at the same time the
single most fixed item that can barely be changed.

Digging deeper into the budget we encountered the second biggest chunk:
**compensation of speakies and helpies**. We decided on a solidarity compensation
for everyone who helps us to make the conference possible, be it a  speakie, a
keynote speakie or a person helping with the doors.

Unfortunately we had the same conundrum here. Should we pay some people less to
reduce the admission fee? Should we only pay keynotes? All of the options that
came to our minds where really no options after all.

Shifting our focus further down the budget we found three items that had the
potential to be downscaled in order to **minimize cost** and therefore reduce
the pricing:

1. Advertisement and decorations (e.g. print media and flags)
2. Merchandise
3. The safety buffer.

### 1) Reducing Advertisement and Decorations

We simply **cut this budget by 50%**. Especially reduction of print media and
online marketing gives us a lot of cost saving. The consequence is that we will
have to do much more legwork ourselves. This includes manually distributing
flyers and posters ourselves, spending more time on Twitter and in general be
more creative with the resources we already have in our hands.

### 2) Rethinking our approach to Merchandise

As you might have noticed through a casual look on our [landing page](/en/), we
are huge fans of fancy and colorful illustrations. Naturally we have the urge
to live up to this by providing stylish merchandise articles to every attendee.
While we still stick to that idea, we **reduced the amount of merch** and
changed the pricing structure.

Instead of assuming that everyone needs a shirt, you can pick a shirt while
buying a ticket. Shirt cost 15 EUR each. By focusing on this approach, we gain
several benefits:

* Cost for merchandise production is shifted towards the individuals that
really want it instead of distributing it on the shoulders of everyone.
* We produce **less waste**. The probability is quite high that if someone
wants a shirt and pays for it that they will wear it in the future.

### 3) The Safety Buffer

We calculated with a small safety buffer in case we would encounter some gross
miscalculations along the way. While this is a wise thing to do in general it
also adds naturally to the overall cost for each attending individual.

Thus came the decision to reduce this budget by 50% as well. During our
extensive budget investigations we came to the conclusion that most positions
where already calculated on a worst-case assumption. Because of this, we can
safely **reduce on our safety buffer, without compromising** the positive
outcome of our little venture too drastically.

### Bonus: Our Approach to Sponsoring

We will have some sponsors on our conference. These sponsors pay a certain
amount of money and in exchange get the chance to use our channels to advertise
for themselves -- e.g. having a logo on our website or even a small booth at
the venue.

Our main paradigm is to reduce the amount of sponsors to a bare minimum in
order to keep the event community-like and provide a meaningful sponsoring to
every company that participates.

We decided to slightly increase the number of sponsors. This enables us to
further shift a fraction of the overall cost away from the admission fee.

## Reaching the Destination of our Journey

After spending a fair share of our time with our heads down on the budget we
arrived at the conclusion that the cost factors mentioned above can be
leveraged to reduce the overall admission fee.

**This lead to a ticket price reduction of more than 20% (starting at 290
EUR)** which will be effective starting December 3rd. All tickets sold so far
will be partially reimbursed to make up the difference to the new ticket
prices.

## On the importance of User Feedback

To conclude we must say that those improvements where only possible because of
the fantastic feedback that reached us so far. Our hope is to get more and more
feedback throughout the road that lays ahead of us.

So in the spirit of user feedback, don't hesitate to drop us [a
