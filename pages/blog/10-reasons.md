Many amazing tech conferences are happening in 2019. The oversupply can make it difficult to decide which one to attend. That is why we came up with 10 reasons which should help you to decide whether our conference is the right one for you.

##1. Our Unique Combination of Tracks
The aspect that differentiates us the most from other technology conferences is our approach to not only focus on tech but also on design and their social impacts. We believe that each and every person that works in the tech industry has a responsibility towards our society. 

Our speaker will not only talk about current technologies but also help you to become more conscious about the consequences your daily work might have on others. Eventually we want you to leave the conference both inspired and with a lot of constructive new thoughts.

##2. Our Magnificent Speaker
We do not offer pay-to-play speaker slots at our conference. We personally believe that a diverse group of people and topics can only be reached by carefully selecting talks that fit our conference's approach best. 

Additionally selecting people ourselves allowed us to choose people that are already known as leading experts in their fields as well as give newcomer a chance to talk about their causes. In the end we are happy to have such a various range of talks from different people with diverse backgrounds and distinct professional expertise.

##3. The Technical Aspect
Apart from deliberating the effects tech and design can have on our society, more two-thirds of our talks will focus on technology-related topics. Our speaker raise a broad range of themes from front- and back-end technologies via infrastructure through to IOT and security. 

We are delighted to won over speaker from companies such as Mozilla, Travis CI, Red Hat, Adesso, Deutsche Telekom and many more.

##4. The Fight for Gender Diversity
Our belief is that the tech industry - among others - needs more diversity in order to continue a healthy and critical dialog. As we are focusing on gender diversity for the first run of our conference we are happy that 60% of our speaker are female/non-binary and 40% are male.

Simultaneously we are working together with communities such as the Digital Media Women, Speakerinnen.org, FemTec, and others to strengthen the network of women* in the technology industry sustainably.

##5. Amazing Organic Food
There is already too much greasy trade fair quality food at events. As food is supposed to be one of the most important things in our lives we picked a caterer that can provide us with amazing regional and organic food over two days.

Believe us, we sacrificed ourselves for the cause of testing this caterer over and over again. And the results were always the same: exceptionally yummy (my stomach is already rumbling)

##6. A Cinema as the Event Location
We chose a program cinema in Cologne Ehrenfeld as it is cozy and at the same time provides amazing acoustics and a great atmosphere for talks. Who wouldn't want to sit in a puffy cinema seat, eating popcorn (yes - we have a popcorn flat-rate) and watching amazing human beings talking about interesting topics?

Additionally the Cinenova provides oneself with an outdoor area and offers plenty of chill and seating possibilities as well as areas to withdraw oneself.

##7. A Full-Time Awareness Team
To create a pleasant, safe and respectful atmosphere for all participants of our conference we have an Awareness-Teams available during the entire event. “Awareness” in this case means the recognition or perception of verbal, psychological or physical violations of personal boundaries.

The Teams consist of two people of different genders and are experienced in the care and consultation of people who have experienced boundary-crossing situations.

##8. A Family-Friendly Event

##9. Equal Payment for all Helper & Speaker

##10. Solidarity Tickets

##11. Eleven?
But wait, didn't we promise you 10 reasons? Well SURPRISE, we saved the best for last: Reason 11 is YOU! 

Without people such as yourself we could never ever manage to make this conference happen in the first place. Even if you can't attend the conference yourself knowing that you just read through all the reasons shows us that you truly care. THANKY YOU for your support and for being such an amazing human-being. You just earned yourself a lifelong stock of hugs!
