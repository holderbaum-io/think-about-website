Many amazing tech conferences are happening in 2019. The oversupply can make it difficult to decide which one to attend. That is why we came up with **10 simple reasons** which will make it easier for you to decide whether to buy a ticket.

##1. Our Unique Combination of Tracks
The aspect that differentiates us the most from other technology conferences is our approach to **not only focus on tech but also on design and their social impacts**. We believe that every person that works in the tech industry has a responsibility towards our society. 

Our speaker will talk about **current technologies** as well as help you to **become more conscious** about the consequences your daily work might have on others. Eventually we want you to leave the conference both inspired and with a lot of new and constructive thoughts.

##2. Our Magnificent Speaker
We do not offer pay-to-play speaker slots at our conference. We personally believe that a **diverse group of people** and topics can only be reached by carefully selecting talks that fit our conference's approach best. 

Additionally selecting people ourselves allowed us to 
ensure **a balance between familiar experts in their fields and newcomer speaker** who deserve the chance to share their perspectives. In the end we are happy to have reached a various range of talks from people with diverse backgrounds and distinct professional expertise.

##3. The Technical Aspect
Apart from deliberating the effects tech and design can have on our society, **more than two-thirds of our talks will focus on technology-related topics**. Our speaker raise a broad range of themes from front- and back-end technologies via infrastructure through to IOT and security. 

We are delighted to have won over speaker from companies such as Mozilla, Travis CI, Adesso, ThoughtWorks, Capgemini, Deutsche Telekom and many more.

##4. Fight for Gender Diversity in Tech
Our belief is that the tech industry - among others - needs more diversity in order to continue a healthy and critical dialog. As we are focusing on gender diversity for the first run of our conference we are happy to announce that **60% of our speaker are female/non-binary and 40% are male**.

Simultaneously we are working together with communities such as the Digital Media Women, Speakerinnen.org, FemTec, and others to strengthen the network of women* in the technology industry sustainably.

*women, non-binary, ...

##5. Amazing Organic Food
There is already too much greasy trade fair quality food at events. As food is supposed to be one of the most important things in our lives we picked a caterer that can provide us with **amazing regional and organic food** over two days.

Believe us, we sacrificed ourselves for the cause of testing this caterer over and over again. And the results were always the same: **exceptionally yummy** and at the same time tenderly cooked meals (my stomach is already rumbling while thinking about it!)

##6. A Cinema as the Event Location
We chose a program cinema in Cologne Ehrenfeld as it is **cozy** and at the same time provides **amazing acoustics and a great atmosphere for talks**. Who wouldn't want to sit in a puffy cinema seat, eating popcorn (yes - we have a **popcorn-flat-rate**) and watching amazing human beings talking about interesting topics?

Additionally the Cinenova provides us with an outdoor area and offers plenty of chill and seating possibilities as well as areas to withdraw oneself.

##7. A Full-Time Awareness Team
To create a pleasant, safe and respectful atmosphere for all participants of our conference we will have an awareness team **available during the entire event**. “Awareness” in this case means the recognition or perception of verbal, psychological or physical violations of personal boundaries.

The team consists of two people of different genders who are **trained in the care and consultation of people who have experienced boundary-crossing situations**. They will be approachable in the course of the entire event.

##8. A Family-Friendly Event
To make it easier for parents to attend the conference we will offer **child-care** for the duration of the event. We will probably have a cozy area inside where children can play, paint and nap. Depending on the weather we also plan on having activities within the closed **outside area** of the cinema.

Additionally we plan to locate a small but **comfortable nursing area** as well as installing **baby change units** in both female and male bathrooms.

##9. Equal Payment for all Helper & Speaker
For our conference we decided on an **equal-compensation-concept for everyone** who helps us to make the conference possible. That means everyone gets the same compensation, be it a (keynote)speaker or a person helping with the doors or doing child care. 

In addition to that all attending speaker get a hotel room and we pay for their travel to Cologne. This is unusual for a conference as most events simply pay for their keynotes or a few very high profile speaker which we personally believe to be inequitable and anti-social.

##10. Solidarity Tickets
One of our main aspects when developing our ticket concept was to include supporter tickets: Those tickets enable us to offer solidarity tickets for people that would otherwise not be able to afford a ticket themselves. **For each supporter ticket 250 EUR go into our solidarity ticket fund**.

Allowing to offer **free or reduced solidarity tickets** supports the overall diversity of the events as people from "outside the tech industry bubble" get access to the conference content as well.  

##11. Eleven?
But wait, didn't we promise you 10 reasons? Well SURPRISE, we saved the best for last: Reason 11 is **YOU**! 

Without people such as yourself we could never ever manage to make this conference happen in the first place. Even if you can't attend the conference yourself knowing that you just read through all the reasons shows us that you truly care. **THANKY YOU** for your support and for being such an amazing human-being. You just earned yourself a lifelong stock of hugs and cookies!
