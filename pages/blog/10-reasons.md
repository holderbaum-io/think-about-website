Many amazing tech conferences are happening in 2019. The oversupply can make it difficult to decide which one to attend. That is why we came up with 10 reasons which should help you to decide whether our conference is the right one for you.

##1. Our Unique Combination of Tracks
The aspect that differentiates us the most from other technology conferences is our approach to not only focus on tech but also on design and their social impacts. We believe that each and every person that works in the tech industry has a certain responsibility towards our society. 

We will not only talk about current technologies but also help you to become more conscious about the consequences your daily work might have on others. Eventually we do not only want you to leave the conference inspired but also to leave with lots of fresh perspectives.

##2. Our Speakers
We do not offer pay-to-play speaker slots at our conference. We personally believe that a diverse group of people and topics can only be reached by carefully selecting talks that fit our conference's approach best. 

Additionally selecting people ourselves sallowed us not only to choose people that are already known as experts in their field but to give newcomer a chance as well. In the end we are happy to have such a diverse range of talks from different people with diverse backgrounds and expertise.
