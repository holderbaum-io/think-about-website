Beginning of January we published our first [blog
post](/blog/learning-from-a-ticket-price-adventure.html) about finding the
right ticket price. Now, after the end of Early Bird sales, we learned some new
things. Let's dive into those!

## What happened so far?

November 15th we launched our ticket sales. This date was preceded by a long
and pretty exhausting journey we embarked on. The designation of this journey
was the finding of a reasonable ticket price and a sensible Early Bird sales
deadline.

Early Bird sales ended on 15th of February and we can say it was a great
success. We sold more tickets than anticipated and reached about one third of
our desired ticket sales goal. This is a pretty amazing result and it shows the
community's interest in an event like Think About!.

## What we learned so far?

Of course, bootstrapping a conference makes you learn a million things along
the way. But in regard to ticket pricing and ticket sales we learned some
pretty interesting things:

### 1. People buy as late as possible

Amazingly, most of the Early Birds tickets where sold in the last
one-and-a-half weeks before the deadline. While this does not sound surprising
in retrospect, we did not anticipate this at such a scale (most sales so close
to the deadline).

### 2. Conference Business is a Cash Flow Business

???

### 3. Scale of Mass is a Thing

???

## How is our Budget impacted?
