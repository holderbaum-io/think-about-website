Beginning of January we published our first [blog
post](/blog/learning-from-a-ticket-price-adventure.html) about finding the
right ticket price. Now, after the end of early bird sales, we learned some new
things. Let's dive into those!

Think About! is a two day tech conference about technology, design and their
impact on society. It will take place in a cozy cinema in Cologne, Germany.

## What happened so far?

November 15th we launched our ticket sales. This date was preceded by a long
and pretty exhausting journey we embarked on. The designation of this journey
was the finding of a reasonable ticket price and a sensible early bird sales
deadline.

Early bird sales ended on 15th of February and we can say it was a great
success. We sold more tickets than anticipated and reached about one third of
our desired ticket sales goal. This is a pretty amazing result and it shows the
community's interest in an event like Think About!.

## What we learned so far?

Of course, bootstrapping a conference makes you learn a million things along
the way. But in regard to ticket pricing and ticket sales we learned some
pretty interesting things:

### 1. People buy as late as possible

Amazingly, most of the early birds tickets were sold in the last
one-and-a-half weeks before the deadline. While this does not sound surprising
in retrospect, we did not anticipate this at such a scale.

### 3. Scale of Mass is a Thing

## Show me the Data!

The net numbers of our budget are by no means affected. We sold about a third
of our sales goal in the first third of our ticket sales campaign. Could not be
better. But we did not anticipate the time distribution of those sales. A
simplified forecast based on the early birds would look roughly like this:

This basically translates into the fact that we will only sell a few tickets
until the beginning of May when the final run starts (the conference takes
place at the 23rd and 24th of May).

## How are we affected by this?

The actual costs for making the Think About! happen are unfortunately distributed in an unpleasantly different shape:

By the end of April, we will have several deposit payments (besides others for
the caterer, the venue and the speaker hotels) that sum up to five figures.

Our current forecast basically tells us, that we will have to advance this
payment from mid of April until end of May, which is a formidable challenge for
a bootstrapped startup without any venture capital.

## Well then?
