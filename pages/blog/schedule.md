We just finished the first version of the schedule. 24 amazing talks spread
over two stages on two days. This article explains a few thoughts and ideas
that went into the specific running order we have now.

Think About! is a two day tech conference about technology, design and their
impact on society. It will take place in a cozy cinema in Cologne, Germany. Go
and check the [scheduled Talks](/en/#schedule)!

## Different Restrictions

Early on, we decided, that the Think About! Conference should cater to
different people. On the one hand we want to be a tech conference with
techy/nerdy software development talks. On the other hand we want to put
emphasis on issues around our social impact as an industry as well as what
design means in the modern days of software development.

This means, we will have many people on site with a multitude of interests and
from different parts of the world. This led the following four goals:

### 1. No Track Collisions

This is one of the reasons why we avoid any collision of tracks. That means at
no point in the schedule will there be two Tech, two Design or two Society
talks in parallel.

This means if you want to see only Tech talks, you can actually see all. If you
don't want to miss the design track, go ahead and watch all design talks. The
same holds of course for the Society track.

### 2. Always an English Option

Since many attendees are non-native Germans, we have to make sure that the
conference is accessible for English speaking folks. Of course, the entire
conference material will be in English.

But we have a few talks that are in German. The schedule ensures, that there is
always at least one English option during each slot.

### 3. Golden Thread of Topics

In each track we have talks of very different areas. To give the schedule this
feeling of being curated it is important to put talks of similar content into
adjacent slots.

It should be avoided to have two talks of a similar category (e.g. two privacy
related talks, one in Tech one in Society) parallel in one slot.

### 4. Individual Speaker Needs

Besides those restrictions, some speakers have individual travel needs.
Sometimes they have to visit another conference the day after or can not be
there in the morning of the first day. Those restrictions applied early on,
luckily just a few speakers where limited in their availability.

## The Result

After a day of discussing and brainstorming using many stickies and an empty
wall we came up with a first version that satisfy all four restrictions that
were mentioned above:

The fully readable version is of course published on our landing page, check it
out [here](/en/#schedule)!

## Final Words

While this is a working version of a schedule now, it is not in concrete yet.
It is more or less guaranteed that in the next few weeks things will come up
that might have an impact on the order of things. A good example is a speaker
who has some new restrictions, that can happen anytime.

Nevertheless, we will make sure that all changes have a minimal impact on the
overall schedule and will preserve the mentioned restrictions.

We are happy about all the amazing people that believe in our cause to make not
only the tech industry but also a part of our society a better and more
inclusive place. **Thank you** so much for supporting us by buying tickets, telling
