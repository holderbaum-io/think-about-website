We just finished the first version of the schedule. 24 amazing talks spread
over two stages on two days. This article explains a few thoughts and ideas
that went into the specific running order we have now.

Think About! is a two day tech conference about technology, design and their
impact on society. It will take place in a cozy cinema in Cologne, Germany.
