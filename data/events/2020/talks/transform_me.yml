track: "design"
abstract: |
  Gabrielle will talk about how hard it is to change. How companies are bought 
  into digital transformation and implementing Lean & Agile methodologies at a 
  high level because they know it is the right thing to do, but they don't want 
  to change their current process. Gabrielle will talk about the pitfalls of 
  companies in implementing Lean & Agile, and wrap up the talk by sharing what 
  she has learned is effective in making organizations lean and changing ingrained 
  behaviors both for traditional organizations and start-ups.
