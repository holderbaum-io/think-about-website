title: "The Miseducation of This Machine"
track: "tech"
abstract: |
  Machine Learning appears to be the solution to all the problems right now,
  whether solvable by tech or (probably) not. While we implement more
  sophisticated algorithms and collect larger amounts of data, most developers
  are lacking an actual understanding of how these algorithms learn. This talk
  will give you an insight into the inner workings of neural networks and their
  decision making to help you stay critical of such results. Because machines
  don't actually learn that much, but humans do. Let's make ML tangible and
  help you become a better machine teacher!

    bio: |
      With degrees in both social and computer science, Laura's spending most
      of her time mediating between the two fields. She was an organizer of
      Rails Girls Berlin for about four years and helped women get their first
      experiences in programming. Currently, she's a working student in a
      research project that analyzes hate speech in the comment sections of
      German news websites, which has increased her need for videos of happy
      kittens as well as coffee, and politicized her even more. She also
      teaches at the intersections of tech at her alma mater.
