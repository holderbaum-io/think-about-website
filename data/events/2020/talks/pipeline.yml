title: "Pipeline: A Chinese Woman’s Journey in(to) a White Man’s World"
track: "society"
abstract: |
  Is there a pipeline problem?  This is a [hot topic in the technology
  industry](https://www.google.de/search?q=pipeline+problem+in+technology),
  since it continues to be dominated by white men, while women and minorities
  remain underrepresented.

  So, is there a pipeline problem?  I won’t try to answer that question in this
  talk.  Instead, I want to shed light on what it’s like to be part of the
  minority in tech - and in society.  I’ll offer you a seemingly rare but
  important glimpse into what it’s like to journey through life as a Chinese
  woman, using a series of short stories from my work and personal life.  From
  having gender and racial stereotypes thrust upon me from a young age, to
  being objectified at work, to uninvited questions about my race and living in
  the “other” box, these experiences have influenced my personal “pipeline” and
  shaped my experience of the technology industry and the world around me.
