title: "The Layers Of The Web"
track: "tech"
abstract: |
  The World Wide Web turned 30 last year. The web has changed quite a bit over
  that time. But progress has been evolutionary rather than revolutionary:

  changes have accreted on top of what has come before. This layered iterative
  approach also works for building websites. Together we'll uncover how to
  build resilient, performant, accessible and beautiful structures that work
  with the grain of the materials of the web.

    bio: |
      Jeremy Keith lives in Brighton, England where he makes websites with the
      splendid design agency [Clearleft](https://clearleft.com/). You may know
      him from such books as [DOM Scripting](https://domscripting.com/),
      [Bulletproof Ajax](https://bulletproofajax.com/), [HTML5 For Web
      Designers](https://html5forwebdesigners.com/), [Resilient Web
      Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com/), and, most recently, [Going
      Offline](https://abookapart.com/products/going-offline).

      He curated the dConstruct conference for a number of years as well as
      [Brighton SF](http://brightonsf.adactio.com/), and he organised the
      world's first [Science Hack Day](http://sciencehackday.org/). He also
      made the website [Huffduffer](https://huffduffer.com/) to allow people to
      make podcasts of found soundsâ€”it's like Instapaper for audio files.

      Hailing from Erin's green shores, Jeremy maintains his link to Irish
      traditional music running the community site [The
      Session](https://thesession.org/). He also indulges a darker side of his
      bouzouki-playing in the band [Salter Cane](https://saltercane.com/).

      Jeremy spends most of his time goofing off on the internet, documenting
      his time-wasting on [adactio.com](https://adactio.com/), where he has
      been writing for over fifteen years.
