title: "Our Banal Binary"
track: "society"
abstract: |
  Binary code is the axiomatic core of computing. It's quite magnificent, if
  you think about it. From the binary, ones and zeros, we have built a universe
  of technology to visualise black holes and record nanoseconds of football
  goals. And while our technological reliance on binary has stemmed
  unfathomable inventions, it has come at an unspoken cost.

  We perceive the world through this lensâ€”ones and zeros signify clear divide
  between one another. It is the same dichotomy that lends itself to Boolean
  thinking: true and false, good and evil, right and wrong, black and white,
  just and unjust.

  From these two simple numbers, we will traverse the impact of binaries on our
  thinking, language, art, and culture; what it means for the technology we
  create and the people and environment for whom and in which we create. We
  will examine the impact of this elegant axiom has limited our expression and
  how it stands as the most monolithic harbinger our future innovations.

  We will seek to fracture the spokes of this wheel and challenge ourselves to
  a new mental model for tech in order to create something intersectional and
  inclusive for all.
