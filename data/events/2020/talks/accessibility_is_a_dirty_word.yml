title: "Accessibility is a Dirty Word"
track: "tech"
abstract: |
  Diversity and inclusion are trending in most organisations and industries (in
  the West). However, majority of websites, apps and interfaces are not
  accessible. Why is this so? How can we change this? I'll be talking about my
  experiences trying build accessibility into the baseline at the companies I
  work for. I'll also share what I know about building inclusive design into
  your process so that you can create accessible products.

    bio: |
      Chimmy Kalu is a product designer who works with companies that put
      people first, helping them create products that solve real problems. She
      believes inclusive design practices should be integrated as the baseline
      for creating products as user-centred products are accessible. Having
      worked as a software engineer for half her career, Chimmy's able to
      translate user needs, technical limitations and business goals into
      designs that are accessible, usable and delightful. Over the last
      decade, Chimmy has worked to help heritage brands like British Airways,
      Vogue and GQ transform their offerings and deliver pioneering products
      and experiences for their customers. She now works with startups and
      entrepreneurs, helping them understand and connect with their user
      base. When she's not creating product, Chimmy also writes and teaches
      about inclusive UX and UI design.
