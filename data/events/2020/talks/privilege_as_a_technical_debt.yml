title: "Privilege as a technical debt"
track: "society"
abstract: |
  Do you believe political correctness and empathy are buzzwords that limit
  the society rather than contribute to its advancement? Do you think talking
  about topics like diversity quotas, privilege doesn't make much sense and
  you would rather spend this time talking about the latest in technology?

  In this talk I would like to take the chance to try and add the missing
  contexts to such terms and arguments, moreover, I will try to go through
  various examples on how it can impact your product from a very pragmatic
  prospective.
