  "You cannot manage what you cannot measure."

  Building a successful business requires more than just understanding customer
  discovery, go-to-market strategies, legal issues, and raising capital.
  Successful businesses are built on foundations that enable leaders to turn
  information into knowledge in order to scale, evolve, and recover.  This
  foundation requires entrepreneurs to understand and implement strategies in
  *Process Management, Organizational Culture for Competitive Advantage, and
  Crisis Management.*

  Going from product/service focused to business model focused takes time and
  intentional effort but is necessary in order to innovate, differentiate, and
  compete in todayâ€™s economic climate. Also, building better businesses and
  communities is a proactive approach to addressing inclusion, diversity, and
  safe spaces in tech.
