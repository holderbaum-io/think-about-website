title: "Please, Release me!"
track: "tech"
abstract: |
  A song sung by every engineer who wants to deploy to production...

  I hold a vision of having every single commit being release-ready for
  production. This is what every team should strive for and put processes in
  place which enable it. But visions are meant to be contested.

  I recently took on the responsibility of release management of a very tricky
  and major project. There was no infrastructure and no guidelines on how to do
  this. In this talk, I will tell you why I volunteered for this role; what
  inspired me; the principles that guided me, and what process I put in place.
  There will be mention of system tests and how they enabled the group to gain
  confidence about their releases. I will also talk about the team dynamics
  which informed the initial difficulty and eventual success for release
  management.

    bio: |
      I work in London as Head of QA of a Fintech firm. I started my career
      thirteen years ago as a QA test engineer in the finance and mobile
      industry. After transitioning to the eCommerce sector, I performed QA in
      various capacities for online restaurant and travel services. I continue
      to work in QA as a manager now with special focus on sustainable delivery
      practices. In addition to this, I have been a keen advocate of creating
      and sustaining diverse teams. As I have transitioned in my career, I have
      found that creating teams which work well together is more challenging
      than the actual project(s) to be delivered by the team. I pay special
      attention to team dynamics and ensuring engineers are in roles which give
      them a sense of purpose. I have also been speaking at schools and
      universities to educate students about what the industry has to offer and
      what a creative space the technology sector can be.
