  An honest conversation about tech burnout, what it is, who it impacts, and
  how to avoid it.

  Tech Burnout is one of the leading complaints in the tech industry. So why
  then do so few people and companies talk about it? In this talk, we will have
  an honest conversation on what tech burnout looks like, who it impacts most
  with real world examples, and how we can avoid it.

  There are various reasons for why we burn out at our tech jobs. One thing is
  for certain, we are burning out. A leading survey taker Blind has year after
  year shown that as much as 60% of our industry feels burned out. I have
  been in the technology industry for over 15 years and have seen first hand
  and experienced first hand the impact of burnout. I will highlight examples
  from my time as well as examples of others. We will talk about what this
  looks like and some of the reasons it can occur. We will also talk about
  ways we can mitigate tech burnout. In the always connected world we are
  immersed in, these challenges are numerous so hopefully you will be able to
  come out of this talk with a better understanding of the signs and
  solutions. We may not be able to beat tech burnout, but hopefully we can
  all at least have an honest conversation about it and how we can try to
  avoid it. This will be relevant for the CEO down to the Junior Developer.
