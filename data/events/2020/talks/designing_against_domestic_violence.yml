title: "Designing Against Domestic Violence"
track: "design"
abstract: |
  The reality of domestic violence doesn’t disappear when people enter the
  digital world. Abusers use technology to exploit and control their victims,
  meaning we have a responsibility to ensure user safety. How can we prevent
  people with violent intentions from using our digital products as tools of
  abuse? There are no silver bullets, but an understanding of the role of
  technology in domestic violence along with thoughtful design can increase
  people’s safety. This talk will help the audience understand the
  intersections of technology and domestic violence and provide a framework
  for designing against domestic violence.
