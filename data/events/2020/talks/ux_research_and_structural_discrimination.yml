title: "Contributions of UX Research to Structural Discrimination - and Ways to Act Against it"
track: "design"
abstract: |
  Discrimination is complex and not approachable as a problem that we define and solve easily. 
  It is difficult to understand how we reproduce it with our daily practices.
  In this talk, I would like to give a short introduction to structural discrimination and 
  focus on how I as a UX Researcher sometimes fail and sometimes succeed to create more 
  inclusive structures in my daily work. My goal is not to provide the „Top five things 
  you can do to stop discrimination“; it is to share the journey I made so far 
  accepting ambiguity in a world where we treat complex problems as they were more simple 
  than they are.
