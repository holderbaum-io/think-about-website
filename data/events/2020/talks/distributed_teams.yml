title: "Distributed Teams - FF through 20 years of out- & in-sourcing"
track: "tech"
abstract: |
  Distributed Software Delivery used to be around cost savings, V-Model, 
  IT standardisation and outsourcing. That was in the 2000s. Today - 20 years later - 
  it is very different setup. Software Teams are agile, distributed and autonomous, 
  because there are barely enough educated and experienced Technologists (or Digital Natives) 
  around, to fulfil the demand for digital products. 

  Dino will share data and personal experience around the change of distributed software 
  development throughout the last 20 years. He will cover the changes in client's perspectives 
  and motivations, economic aspects and touch impact on society. Part of that change journey 
  are advances in technology (bandwidth, latency & collaboration tools) and in methods 
  (autonomy of teams, value breakdown structures and feedback loops).
