title: "Testing Techniques for Component Driven Development"
track: "tech"
abstract: |
  The web development, especially the frontend development has changed a lot
  over the last years. Nowadays, we can choose from a numerous range of
  different helper libraries to find solutions for various problems. Component
  Driven Development and Design systems are becoming very popular. Has that
  also changed the way we should, want and can test our code? Frontend Testing
  is an opinionated topic. There are a lot of highly regarded developers who
  have tried out TDD once and never gone back. Also, some might argue that
  particularly (Frontend) Unit Testing is not useful. In this talk, we will
  have a look at the past and present of JavaScript Testing. With this
  background, we will discuss new possibilities of Testing for Component-Based
  Frameworks, like Snapshot and Visual Regression Testing.
