title: "Are quality engineers still necessary in modern ages?"
track: "tech"
abstract: |
  Sometimes I hear from developers: "I'm already automating tests, why should I
  have quality engineers in the team?".

  In fact, when you are doing it you are ensuring that your code is correct
  from logic point of view, not that is the correct code from the customer
  one.

  This talk aims to clarify the misunderstood about QA role in development
  teams, demonstrating how QAs are required and why they should be part to achieve 
  the goals for your product.

  Although it is irrelevant the difference between testing and development
  in terms of responsibility, it not the same in terms of roles.
