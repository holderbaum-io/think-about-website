  Before I started my career in software development, I worked for many years
  as a dog trainer. The experiences I made in this time are the reason why I
  immediately fell in love with testing. So, let’s talk about TDD! TDD stand
  for Test-driven development and it’s not only a technique to write tests but
  also a design process in software development. I want to give you a new
  perspective on this process and explain how to TDD with the help of
  comparing it to how to train a dog. TDD has much in common with
  dogtraining, so at the end of my talk you should be able to write a piece
  of c test driven code, and also teach a dog a little trick - well, the last
  thing at least theoretically.

    bio: |
      While Mirjam began programming at the age of eleven, her career didn’t
      start in that field. She worked as an accountant, management assistant
      and office administrator and after that became a dog trainer with a main
      focus on behavioral issues. After many years working with people and
      their dogs she changed her career for the second time and became a
      frontend developer. Currently, Mirjam is working at BRYTER, where she
      helps building a no-code automation platform with lots of tests in the
      front-end!
