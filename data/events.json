Having been a fighter for diversity and equal rights all my lifetime, today one of my main interests is how to make sure that techniques and algorithms do not discriminate against race or gender and to awake awareness on this topic and its effects on society.\r\n\r\n\r\nAls Mathematikerin und IT-Beraterin arbeite ich in den Bereichen Data Science und Künstliche Intelligenz. Schon mein ganzes Leben lang setze ich mich für Vielfalt und Gleichberechtigung ein. Im Moment interessiere ich mich vor allem für Diskriminierung durch Algorithmen: Wie sie entsteht, welche Auswirkungen sie hat und wie man sie verhindern kann.",

Since then, we’ve seen trends like having devs be on call for code that they write and having operability reviews before new features ship to production - both positive ways that operational thinking has impacted development work. There is plenty that can be learned from the dev side of things as well. This talk will look at ways that development best practices can be applied to work that has traditionally fallen in the realm of operations, using server provisioning as an example. We’ll also look at the underlying principles behind CI/CD and how those can become a key part of an ongoing culture of organizational learning.",

Dennoch sind wir von Dingen umgeben, die diesen Anspruch nicht erfüllen und uns, sowie unserer Umwelt sogar schaden. Die Forschung zur kognitiven Dissonanz im Produktdesign versucht zu erklären, warum wir beim Entwickeln neuer Designs oftmals gegen unsere eigenen moralischen Werte handeln und wie wir das Spannungsfeld zwischen Individualmoral und Innovationszwang lösen können.\r\n",

What's surprising about this research is the impact of our mindset on creativity and innovation, estimation, and collaboration in and out of the workplace. I'll share what we know so far about this mindset and offer some practical suggestions to help all of us become even more agile.",
